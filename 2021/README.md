## OVERVIEW OF CAUSE

[CAUSE Webpage](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/)

CAUSE is a national organization whose mission is to support and advance undergraduate statistics education, in four target areas: 

- resources, 
- professional development, 
- outreach, and 
- research. 


### Overview of CAUSE Research (Dennis Pearl)

[CAUSE Research Webpage and Initiatives](https://causeweb.org/cause/research)

MISSION: 

- Establish the area of statistics education research as a recognized discipline with a visible presence. 
- Connect researchers from diverse disciplines that inform knowledge about teaching and learning statistics, collect and disseminate resources on research in statistics education.
- Promote statistics education research. 

---

## Breakout Session #1: Connecting with the Community

- Give your group a sense of your statistics education research journey (e.g., areas of interest, questions of interest).
- Reflect on your observations you had while reading the 2012 Connecting Research to Practice report.

## Expectations for the Breakout Sessions

- Not a listening session, encourage everyone to participate
- Assign roles (based on latitude)

Person who is...   | Role         | Task                 
------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------
Furthest north     | Note-taker   | Takes notes in slides
2nd furthest north | Facilitator  | Keeps conversation on topic
3rd furthest north | Time keeper  | Ensures sufficient time on each question
2nd furthest south | Spokesperson | Reports during large group debrief
Furthest south     | Includer     | Makes sure everyone feels included

- Outreach to engage those who may want to connect with CAUSE
- More regular satellite/research meetings in the future
- Want to do more??  Please let us know if you…
  + Are interested in further conversations to update the CR2P document 
  + Would like to help make things happen for one of the potential CAUSE Research initiatives discussed today
